#Griffin Hampton Triangle Area Assignment 1 CSE-120
width = int(input("Width is: "))
height = int(input("Height is: "))
print("Area is:", int((.5*width)*height))
#this program works by converting the user inputs to ints and them multiplying the width by .5 in the print statement
# and then multiplying it by the height, I used parenthesis to accurately use the triangle area equation
