#Griffin Hampton max min program

set_Val = {2,3,5,10,15,20}
print(f"Set Elements: \n{set_Val}\n")
print(f"Maximum value of the set is: \n{max(set_Val)}\n")
print(f"Minimum value of the set is: \n{min(set_Val)}\n")

This program works by using pythons' built in min and max functions
I did it this way to save time.
